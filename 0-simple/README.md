# React.JS

## What is React?

Is basically a declarative library for constructing UIs.

if you ask me, I'l tatell you that react is a Javscript library for building component based UIs. So the basic building block of react is, no surprise, called a component. So you can assemble React components essentially tree structure to build up an interface that's as complicated as you want it to be. In keeping with the idea of a tree, you can have a ton of leaf components, or you can build components with child components, that might even have more child components.
